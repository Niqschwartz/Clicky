# Clicky Game

This app is a game that puts 12 pictures on the page. The object of the game is to click on every picture, but only once. If you click the same picture more than once, the game is over. After every click the pictures shuffle in a random order.

The app keeps your current score, and also displays your top score.


Currently the game is fully functional. On my local branch I have the pictures sized so they can all be seen on the screen at the same time, but on my deployed Heroku page something is happening where the pictures are all different sizes.
